--Classes--

Javascript uses prototype for inheritance, but classes provides better syntax.

Inside classes constructor function is used to create new object.

Methods can be defined in a similar way as on objects, but unlike objects there is no commas between them.

Static methods are attched to the contructor or the class itself, insetead of instance.

Subclasses can be created by using 'extends' keyword.

The Super keword can be used to call methods on the parent class.

--Mixins--

Mixins are like abstract classes or template for classes.

--Enums--

Are TS specific, basically a list of specific values.
